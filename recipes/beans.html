    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over 
            medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly 
            browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a 
            paper towel-lined plate. Let cool, and crumble.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the ground beef and onions into a large skillet over 
            medium heat, and cook and stir until the meat is no longer 
            pink, breaking the meat apart as it cooks, about 10 
            minutes. Drain excess grease. Transfer the beef and onion 
            mixture into a large Dutch oven. Stir in the crumbled 
            bacon, honey barbecue sauce, pork and beans, kidney beans, 
            lima beans, black beans, brown sugar, cider vinegar, 
            liquid smoke, salt, and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover, and bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, 
            about 1 hour.
        </li>
    </ol>
