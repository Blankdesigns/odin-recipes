    <p>
        Brunswick stew is a tomato-based Southern stew made with meat 
        and vegetables. The budget-friendly dish was originally made 
        with small game meats, but now it is often made with chicken 
        and pork. It is typically enhanced with condiments such as 
        barbecue sauce and ketchup, giving it a sweet and savory 
        flavor that’s impossible to resist.
